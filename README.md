<h2 align="center"> Where to Ask a Question? :question: </h2> 
  
There is an `issues` tab right up there :point_up:. Cannot find it? Click <a href='https://github.com/CISC-CMPE-327/Assignment-Instructions/issues'>HERE</a>. To ask a question, follow two steps:
- Frist, search for related issue using the `Filters` box. 
- If no one asked before, create an issue with a title that summazie your whole question. Then fill in the body of your question. You can copy screenshot and parse into the text box as well.
